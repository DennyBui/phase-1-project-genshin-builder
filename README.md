## Website to build genshin characters.

![GIF](Genshin-project-walkthrough.gif)

My website is a web application that displays a collection of characters from a popular video game. The website allows users to view details about each character, including their name, rarity, element, and recommended artifacts to use when building that character.

### Features:
View a collection of characters with their images, name, rarity, and element.
Click on a character's "Build Character" button to display a list of recommended artifacts to use when building that character.
Search for characters by name using the search bar.
Hover over element image to see what element a character is.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### How to Use:
- First use json-server --watch db.json in the terminal to grab the db.json elements
- Open the index.html file in a web browser.
- Scroll through the list of characters, or use the search bar to find a specific character by name.
- Click on a character's "Build Character" button to display a list of recommended artifacts to use when building that character.
- You can also see a characters element if you hover over the element image

### Future Plans and Improvement:
- I want to be able to let users suggest their own builds.
- Maybe find a way to have more than just one artifact set, some characters require two different sets.
- I want to be able to have a button that randomly selects a character for the user
- I want to add a function that will let users click on a weapon image near the bottom and it will show a character's recommended weapon

## Installation: 
Use the package manager pip to install foobar.
